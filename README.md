**GE-1 Assignment 1**

*My project:*

The aim of my project was to create a dungeon crawler like the binding of isacc or the more simularly like the Stardew valley minigame journey of the prairie king(https://bit.ly/2pwZEaz) Where you face a wave of enemies coming at you to try and kill you in each room, until you get a certain ammount of points from shooting/surviving them to move on to the next room. Or possible time limit coutdown till doors open. If the enemy touches you, you will die instantly, therefore will try and implement a 3 lives system, including diffrent enemy types. If keep winning and move room from room will eventually hopefully lead you to the boss room and fight it. Using a top down camera view to emulate a 2D system like in the game (or in a grid format), while using what we have learned in the labs and in the unity tutorials.

*What the game will hopefully include:* 

- [ ] 3 Lives system
- [x] Points/score system
- [ ] Random map/room/dungeon layout
- [x] Using the lab tutorials as a base example
- [ ] Randomly generated terrain/walls to obsucre the enemy swarm and your shooting in each room
- [ ] Enemies drop random power ups to change  your shooting mechanics or other mechanics
- [ ] A possible grid layout use to spawn an item or barrier in each square.
- [ ] Diffrent enemy types I.e stronger armour needing more shoots to kill, faster or more
- [x] Top down camera view to emulate a 2D feel (2.5D)
- [ ] Possible pure 2D or 3D  styles
- [ ] Boss battle at the end
- [ ] Possible other features
