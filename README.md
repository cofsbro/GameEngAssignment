**GE-1 Assignment 1**

*My project:*

The aim of my project was to create a dungeon crawller like the binding of isacc or the more simularly like the Stardew valley minigame journey of the prairie king where you face a wave of enemies until you get a certain ammount of points to move on to the next room, till you get to the boss room and fight the boss. 

*What the game will hopefully include:* 

- [ ] Random Map layout
- [ ] Randomly generated terrain/walls to obsucre the enemy swarm and shooting
- [ ] Enemies drop random gun power ups to change shooting mechanics
- [ ] Diffrent enemy types I.e stronger armour, faster or more
- [ ] Possible other features
- [ ] Use the tank mechanics we done in the labs to make a 3d version of the game or have it in 2D
- [ ] If not allow you to choose 2D or 3D versions
