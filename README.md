**GE-1 Assignment 1**

*My project:*

The aim of my project was to create a dungeon crawler like the binding of isacc or the more simularly like the Stardew valley minigame journey of the prairie king #26 where you face a wave of enemies coming at you to kill you in each room, until you get a certain ammount of points from shooting/surviving them to move on to the next room. If the enemy touches you, you will die instantly, therefore will try and implement a 3 lives system, including diffrent enemy types. If keep winning and move room from room will eventually hopefully lead you to the boss room and fight it. Using a top down camera view to emulate a 2D system like in the game (or in a grid format), while using what we have learned in the labs and in the unity tutorials.

*What the game will hopefully include:* 

- [ ] 3 Lives system
- [ ] Points/score system
- [ ] Random map/room/dungeon layout
- [ ] Using the lab tutorials a
- [ ] Randomly generated terrain/walls to obsucre the enemy swarm and your shooting in each room
- [ ] Enemies drop random power ups to change  your shooting mechanics or other mechanics
- [ ] A possible grid layout use to spawn an item or barrier in each square.
- [ ] Diffrent enemy types I.e stronger armour needing more shoots to kill, faster or more
- [ ] Top down camera view to emulate a 2D feel
- [ ] Hopefully see if can change the camera posisition and movement speed to make it look more 3D versions
- [ ] Boss battle at the end
- [ ] Possible other features
