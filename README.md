# GameEngAssignment
**GE-1 Assignment 1**

*My project:*

The aim of my project was to create a dungeon crawler like the binding of isacc or the more simularly like the Stardew valley minigame journey of the prairie king where you face a wave of enemies comming at you to kill you, until you get a certain ammount of points from shooting to move on to the next room. Or die with a 3 lives system. If keep winning hopefully leads you to the boss room and fight it. Use a top down camera view to emulate a 2D system using a grid movement system and using what we have learned in the labs

*What the game will hopefully include:* 

- [ ] 3 Lives system
- [ ] Points system
- [ ] Random map layout and/or dunegon layout
- [ ] Randomly generated terrain/walls to obsucre the enemy swarm and shooting
- [ ] Enemies drop random gun power ups to change shooting mechanics
- [ ] Diffrent enemy types I.e stronger armour, faster or more
- [ ] Possible other features
- [ ] Top down camera view
- [ ] Hopefully see if can change the camera to make it look more 3D versions
- [ ] Boss battle at the end
